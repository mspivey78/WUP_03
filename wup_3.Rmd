## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data


## Now add in boxplot
```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```

The boxes are not disjointed. The back box, the median is higher than the people at the front and the middle box.  

## Numerical Summarys 

## Inferential Tests

## Conclusions
